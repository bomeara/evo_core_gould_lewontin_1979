## Learning objectives

-   Describe the "adaptationist programme"

-   Understand arguments against it and for it

-   Understand how scientific arguments can be made

-   Consider adaptationism in other areas

## Scenarios

Is this from natural selection? Will it increase fitness? How do you know?

-   An ecologist finds that within a plant species, the individuals in more arid environments have more mycorrhizal fungi.

-   Whales' heart rate goes down when holding their breath.

-   Humans' heart rate goes down when holding their breath.

-   Are all native elements of an ecosystem coevolved?

## Modern

Let's look at the current issue of *Evolution*: <https://academic.oup.com/evolut/issue>

## Questions

-   How to avoid separating organisms into traits?

-   What is the appropriate null model: adaptation or not?

-   Why does it matter which "side" Darwin was on?

-   What is "selection without adaptation"?

-   What is "adaptation without selection"?

-   How can we distinguish things evolved by natural selection from those evolving due to non-adaptive reasons?

## Questions

-   What other examples of architectural constraints?

-   "I liked this paper because it gave the view of scientists wanting to have the right answer and sort of cramming answers into ways to make them fit. How do we take imperical evidence and avoid trying to fit it into a box while still dealing with the limits of the facts of the information that we have available?"

-   Since this paper in 1979, has the general view of evolution changed?

-   What is a phyletic constraint / inertia? \[maybe use mollusks\]

-   Neoteny vs recapitulatory

-   "Why are two of the European alternatives theories about a species' body plan (Bauplan) divided into "strong" and "weak" forms? Is it because the former had support from major theorists?"
